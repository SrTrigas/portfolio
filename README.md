# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! Here you will find a collection of projects where I apply Data Science techniques and skills to solve problems and extract valuable insights from data. This README will provide an overview of the repository contents and how to navigate through them.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
|-- Machine Learning (Statistical Learning)
|   |-- README.md
|   |-- Code
|   |-- Data
|-- r_Euler
|   |-- README.md
|   |-- Code
|   |-- Data
|-- Regression
|   |-- README.md
|   |-- Code
|   |-- Data
|-- README.md
```

Projects are dividev by categories, each project resides in its own category folder with its respective README.md file providing detailed information about the projects in this category, including the context, objectives, methods used, and results obtained. 
Additionally, each folder contains the code used for the project, as well as the datasets necessary to reproduce the results.

## Projects

Here is a brief overview of some of the projects included in my Data Science Portfolio:

1. **Project1**: In this project, I utilized machine learning techniques to predict housing prices using a real estate sales dataset. I explored different regression models and evaluated their performance using metrics such as mean squared error and coefficient of determination.

2. **Project2**: In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis on a customer dataset for a company. I employed data visualization techniques to identify patterns, customer segments, and obtain relevant insights for business decision-making.

3. **Project3**: In this project, I worked on a classification problem using neural networks. I used an image dataset to train a classification model capable of recognizing different object categories. I implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and evaluated the model's performance using precision and recall measures.

These are just examples of the projects included in my portfolio. Each project has its own README.md file where you can find more details about the problem tackled, the approach used, and the results obtained.

1. Navigate to the directory of the project you are interested in.
2. Read the README.md file to gain detailed information about the project, including objectives, methodology, and results.
3. Explore the provided code to understand how Data Science techniques were implemented in the project.
